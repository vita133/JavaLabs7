*Topic:* 
Working with collections in the Java programming language.<br><br>
*Goal:*
Acquiring skills in creating your own and using standard ones collections in the Java programming language.

### Task
1. Create a class that describes a typed collection (the collection type is generic
laboratory work class No. 6), which implements the interface given by the option (item 2)
and has a given internal structure (item 3). Implement all methods of the interface, and
also create at least 3 constructors (1 – empty, 2 – in which
1 object of the generalized class is transferred, 3 - into which the standard one is transferred
collection of objects). All initial data is specified in the execution method. Code
must meet JCC standards and be thoroughly documented.

### Variant

*Topic:* 
Exception handling and the basics of testing in a programming language Java.<br><br>
*Goal:*
Acquisition of skills in the use of the mechanism for handling exceptional situations
and writing tests to check the performance of methods in the language
Java programming.

### Task
1. Modify classes from previous laboratory works (laboratory work No. 6
and No. 7) in such a way that the processing of exceptional situations takes place according to
using standard tools of the Java programming language. Create your own
exception handler class.
2. Write JUnit tests to test the functionality of ALL methods and
exceptional situations.
3. All initial data are specified in the executive method. The code must match
JCC standards and be thoroughly documented.
